For this assignment you should read the task, then below the task do what it asks you to do
based on what the task tells you do first.
EXAMPLE TASK:
'''
#EX) Declare a variable set to 3. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 0.
i = 3;
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1

'''While Loops'''
#1) Declare a variable set to 4. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 1.
r = 4;
while r > 1
    print(r)
    r-= 1

#2) Declare a variable set to 14. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and increments the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 20.
k = 14
while k > 20
    print(k)
    r -= 1
#3) Declare a variable set to 55. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#   you just created. Then make an if statement that makes the loop break when
#   the variable is equal to 50. 
y = 55
while y > 50
    print(y)
    y -= 1 

'''For Loops'''
#4) Create a list named sports. Put three sports into the list. Create
#   a for loop that prints each sport in the list
"sports","sports","sports"
while "sport" > 3
    print("sport
#5) Create a for loop that loops through each letter in a string of one of your
#   favorite songs. Each iteration should print should a letter of the word. 
 a = "j","a","i","l","h","o","u","s","e","r","o","c","k"
 while a > 13
    print(a)
#6) Create a list named movies. Put five of your favorite movies into the list.
#   However, make sure one of the movies is Avatar. 
#   Create a for loop that iterates over the list. In the loop print the movie
#   being looped over, but create an if statement that breaks out of the 
#   loop if it is Avatar.
movies = "Avatar","Transforms","Real steal","Jurassic park", "Film Z"
while movies > 8
    print(movies)
    movies -= "Avatar"
